Prajna - Transcendental Inner Peace (TIP) - in Sound via "<a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/nature-of-things.html#Section_2.1" target="_blank">#PrajnaTIPinSound</a>" is a "<b>topic</b>" for public connections and contributions to form statistically significant community consensus of practical objectives. It maintains open-source tools <b>on the demand side</b> of any <b>Service</b> - riding on available <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/" target="_blank">KhaiPhong</a> streaming and cryptographic platform - to enable interest parties connect to the "<b>topic</b>" for an action about the service. The open-source tools <b>on the supply side</b> is maintained at <a href="https://github.com/prajnakhaiphong/prajnatipinsound" target="_blank">the organization account</a>.

Similar to <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/personaai" target="_blank">PersonaAI</a> and <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/mu" target="_blank">Mu Command Centre</a>, the tools are parts of REST API and Proxy Servers to available <b>topics</b> whose data are stored in its private <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/personadb" target="_blank">PersonaDB</a> for data processing and statements of TRUTH from community ledger. Different from <b>specialized cryptographic systems</b> where transactions in the ledger - serving its specific purpose such as <b>Bitcoin</b> - are distributedly maintained in specialized secured systems, the KhaiPhong eco-system maintains its transaction logs at one secure place plus at specified ThankYou Clubs for fast accesses, and the <b>"involved parties' private PersonsaDB"</b> for the legal entity <b>Deep Learning</b> in its private <b>PersonaAI</b>. For example, your action on the topic "<a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/nature-of-things.html#Section_2.1" target="_blank">#PrajnaTIPinSound</a>" is in the stream of its central database, plus possible distribution to the selected ThankYou Clubs and your private PersonaDB when requested. You can request the global or local community actions streaming to you for your own viewing, investigating, modeling and/or simulations.

The <b>supply side</b> of <a href="https://github.com/prajnakhaiphong/prajnatipinsound" target="_blank">#PrajnaTIPinSound</a> is the implementation of Buddhist <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/references.html#D33" target="_blank">Shurangama Sutra</a> to (1) prove the existence of "<b>the Unchanged and Unborn / Oneness / No-Conflict Consciousness</b>" in the changing (viparinama-dukkha) and conditioned (sankhara-dukkna) existence having "<b>Natural Purification</b>" to naturally "<b>Purify</b>" your tainted senses, (2) let you contrast with the state of "Kindness" (mettā - tâm từ) and Empathy (karuṇā - tâm bi) that you actually know, and used as the Vietnamese General's - <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/references.html#R7.4" target="_blank">Trần Hưng Đạo's</a> - principle to cultivate a strong community capable to militarily defeat three times the Mongol Empire, (3) debunk <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/references.html#D19" target="_blank">esoteric scam process</a> of the impostor <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/glossary.html#AvalokiteshvaraBodhisattva" target="_blank">Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva</a> in liberating humanity from planned masters-slaves relationships. This Freedom from masters-slaves relationships is evidenced in the collapse - due to Natural Laws and the Good Forces - of Illuminati elites and fast changing in the new Era of Conscious Living in the true meaning of Latin Humanitas (biology, compassion and wisdom/prajna).

The patented technology will be publicly Do-It-Yourself (DIY) open source with the know-hows in <b>proper cares and managements</b> we learned in field research of 45+ years from the failure of <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/references.html#D54" target="_blank">Transcendental Meditation (TM<sup>&#169;</sup>)</a> due to its founder's <b>Inner Depth</b> not yet reaching <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/right-inner-peace.html#Section_3" target="_blank">Purity Signed Post</a> to know the driving force at the source of his thought for proper management of his reality. He has revised his "Insight" based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beJQUNJlilY" target="_blank">further reflection</a> of 30+ years after an unworthy scandal. It has to be patented having reasonable trained professional helps to prevent <b>global armies of criminals and professional scam artists</b> in Buddhism jumping on the bandwagon, <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/references.html#D19" target="_blank">claiming to know what they do not Know to see what they do not See</a> in 2500+ years of cheating humanity that we have done from 2007 to expose the cheating processes in exploiting <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/references.html#R8" target="_blank">human mind</a> as "Is Hypnosis Fake?" of their <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/budh-dharma-and-buddhism.html" target="_blank">named leaders in Buddhism</a>. It is possible to <b>be beyond tainted senses with "KhaiPhong Technologies"</b>, coming from discovered natural laws to enable most people passing the <b>Gateway-to-Oneness</b> and beyond, and verifiable in Deep Learning as statistically significant community epistemic objectives. Professional helps are required if (1) you do not actually know after 3 months of DIY and/or wish to dedicate resources to speed up your exloration of different <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/right-inner-peace.html#Section_3" target="_blank">Gotama's Signed Posts</a>, (2) you cannot self manage psychological scar <b>awaken by the power of Samadhi</b> as an indication of the Nature that it is the time to do something for your valued <b>Continuity of the Consciousness</b>.

Current technologies to be freshly implemented in <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/" target="_blank">KhaiPhong</a> make it easier for you - using your innate "<b>Buddha Nature / Kingdom of God from within</b>" - being a part of the community Conscious Living, contrasting the <b>Natural Purification</b> from transcendental "<a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/nature-of-things.html#Section_2.1" target="_blank">#PrajnaTIPinSound</a>" with the Kindness and Empathy that you have been taken for granted to <b>be diverted to narrower scopes</b> of all isms (such as Confucianism, Nationalism) where major organized religions (such as Catholicism, Islam, Buddhism) are parts. Due to our public expositions in the past 10+ years, hard-core persistent professional scam artists in Buddhist Sangha continue shifting their described veils to indoctrinate the young and novice of their <b>Three Jewels</b> (the Buddha, Dharma, and the teachings expounded by the Sangha) while the Essence of the Dharma is <b>transcending all binding Word/Image and clinging Thought</b>. Qualified students in our inner circle have had many dedicated lives in well-known contributions for Buddhism and other religions. Different from the mass, once they passed <b>Equanimity</b> to naturally detach from binding Word/Image, and <b>Purity</b> for natural detachment from clinging Thought, they ride on their <b>verifiable consciousness states</b> to explore underlying natural laws of Thing-As-It-Is and <b>then What?</b> The outcome is "<a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/finger-pointing-to-moon.html#Section_3" target="_blank">scientific proof of Gotama's degeneration</a>" to personally prove the equality in Human Rights and everyone can be a positive part of the whole, rather than being stuck at past achievements and fallen into a crack of self deduction as Gotama!

In your private <b>PersonaDB and PersonaAI</b>, you must expose your inner actuality in direct contact with the <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/references.html#R6" target="_blank">Dharma / God / Allah</a> as Thing-As-It-Is in Kindness and Empathy beyond the conflicting logic on the duality plane. Your contributions as parts of the Conscious Living will enable Deep Learning expose statistically significant community epistemic objectives. This kind of Deep Learning is applicable to all processes of community consensus. Applying this process to other topics in <b>Making Life Easier and Happier</b> such as #CompassionPrajna, #DhyanaSamadhi, #SamadhiPrajna, <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/right-inner-peace.html#Section_3" target="_blank">#SamadhiSign</a>, #BlankMind, #NaturalSilence, #SixthSense, #SeventhSense, #HappyCouple, #HappyFamily, #HappyPerson, #Sketch2Strategy, #Education, #Pharmaco, #Yoga, <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/references.html#R11" target="_blank">#ChiKung</a>, #TaiChi, etc, not all topics need to verify the transcendental states of "<b>Emptying the Contents</b>". Any proven thing to enable human biology properly in-tune with <b>Nature</b> such as <b>TaiChi and ChiKung</b> from Chinese Wisdom or <b>Yoga</b> from Indian Wisdom is a part of Conscious Living. <b>Inner Happiness</b> do contribute to deeper outside manifestations and their Raison D'être. That is why Consciousness Technologies drive the allocation of resources to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and AI enables Consciousness Technologoes parts of a solid science.

From recently connected friends and associates, we know two persons using Sound in different ways of our transcendental "<a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/nature-of-things.html#Section_2.1" target="_blank">#PrajnaTIPinSound</a>" due to long past cultivation. One uses music to transcendental states. One uses sound at different vibrations to transcendental states. We encourage them to reverse engineering in searching for reproducible optimal conditions to different transcendental states and contrast with <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/right-inner-peace.html#Section_3" target="_blank">Gotama's recorded Samadhi</a> as we have done in 45+ years after actually knowing what Gotama knew. Their contributions will be parts of this topic.
