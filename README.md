Prajna - Transcendental Inner Peace (TIP) - in Sound via "<a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/nature-of-things.html#Section_2.1" target="_blank">#PrajnaTIPinSound</a>" is a "<b>topic</b>" for public connections and contributions to form statistically significant community consensus of practical objectives. It maintains open-source tools <b>on the demand side</b> of any <b>Service</b> - riding on available <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/" target="_blank">KhaiPhong</a> streaming and cryptographic platform - to enable interest parties connect to the "<b>topic</b>" for an action about the service. The open-source tools <b>on the supply side</b> is maintained at <a href="https://github.com/prajnakhaiphong/prajnatipinsound" target="_blank">the organization account</a>.

Similar to <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/personaai" target="_blank">PersonaAI</a>, the tools are parts of REST API to available <b>topics</b> whose data are stored in its private <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/personadb" target="_blank">PersonaDB</a> for data processing and statements of TRUTH from community ledger. Different from <b>specialized cryptographic systems</b> where transactions in the ledger - serving its specific purpose such as <b>Bitcoin</b> - are distributedly maintained in specialized secured systems, the KhaiPhong eco-system maintains its transaction logs at only one centralized place plus at specified ThankYou Club for fast accesses, and the <b>"involved parties' private PersonsaDB"</b> for the legal entity <b>Deep Learning</b> in its private <b>PersonaAI</b>. For example, your action on the topic "<a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/nature-of-things.html#Section_2.1" target="_blank">#PrajnaTIPinSound</a>" is in the stream of its secure database, plus possible distribution to the selected ThankYou Clubs and your private PersonaDB when requested. You can request the global or local community actions streaming to you for your own viewing, investigating, modeling and/or simulations.

The <b>supply side</b> of <a href="https://github.com/prajnakhaiphong/prajnatipinsound" target="_blank">#PrajnaTIPinSound</a> is the implementation of Buddhist <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/references.html#D33" target="_blank">Shurangama Sutra</a> to (1) prove the existence of "<b>the Unchanged and Unborn / Oneness / No-Conflict Consciousness</b>" in the changing (viparinama-dukkha) and conditioned (sankhara-dukkna) existence having "<b>Natural Purification</b>" to naturally "<b>Purify</b>" your tainted senses, (2) let you contrast with the state of "Kindness" (mettā - tâm từ) and Empathy (karuṇā - tâm bi) that you actually know, and used in the Vietnamese General - <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/references.html#R7.4" target="_blank">Trần Hưng Đạo</a> - principle to cultivate a strong community capable to military defeat three times the Mongol Empire, (3) debunk <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/references.html#D19" target="_blank">esoteric scam process</a> of the impostor <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/glossary.html#AvalokiteshvaraBodhisattva" target="_blank">Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva</a> in liberating humanity from planned masters-slaves relationships.
